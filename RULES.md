* Place the level card and ready cards on the table.
* Shuffle the boss deck and place it on the table.
* Shuffle the player deck and draw 5 cards.

# Turns

## Boss Phase

* Flip the top card of the boss deck.
* If the player token is on a space indicated for damage, discard a number of cards equal to the damage number. Remove all cards from the Ready! track and place them in the discard.
* Note the Delay value - the player gets to take that many actions before the next boss phase.

## Player Phase

* Choose a card to play on the Ready! track. The card must have a ">" on the left that matches one of the ">" symbols on the previous card.
* Take the action specified on the card, which may be moving the token, jumping, or firing on the boss.
* If you can't (or don't want to) play a card, remove all cards but the Ready! card from the Ready! track and place them in your discard pile. Discard one card from your hand.
* Draw another card and repeat until you've taken the number of actions equal to the delay on the current boss card.

# Game End

If your hand is empty, you lose. Try again! If you remove the last health token for the boss, you win!
